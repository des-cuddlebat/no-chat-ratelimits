## no-chat-ratelimits
Removes vanilla's 10 messages / 10s ratelimit, letting plugins handle spam instead.

The motiviation for the mod comes from the fact that the vanilla ratelimit counts for instance text menu interactions or commands as messages, despite those interactions not necessarily spamming other players.
